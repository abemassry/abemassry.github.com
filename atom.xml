    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>What Entrepreneurs can Learn from LOST</h1>

<p>The TV show Lost managed to nail three things right in the product category: the right product, the right place, and the right time.</p>

<p>Originally I didn’t catch Lost when it aired on TV, I marathoned all the seasons when they were released on netflix.  But after watching the show I could see why my friends and coworkers were hooked.  I didn’t put the connection together till now, of how the show could be applied to everyday life.</p>

<h2>It was one of the first shows to wholeheartedly make the jump to HD.</h2>

<p>When it first aired to when it ended, it made the jump to HD and was better for it.  The cinematographers really took advantage of not only the higher resolutions but also the lush landscapes that were present in the show because they were shooting on location.  This had to do with the timing and taking advantage of the technology that was present at the time.</p>

<h2>It was available on DVD after the season had aired.</h2>

<p>While DVD is not an HD viewing experience per se, the quality was a lot better than VHS tapes.  And while there were other shows that did this as well, they nailed this one as well.</p>

<h2>It was available for online streaming.</h2>

<p>Hulu was starting to come out with content at the time, but ABC had its own streaming solution from its site.  Whether or not you agree with either of these, people could still watch it on the internet at their leisure, not encumbered by when it aired.  They could also see higher quality video then if they had set their VCRs to record it.  In addition DVRs were starting to come into prominence and it had the same benefit as online streaming when it came to picture quality.</p>

<p>So I keep belaboring quality when it comes to all these things, what made this particular show so special, there were other HD shows at the time, some of them even filmed on location.  It was the fact that it was filmed on location with an almost cinema quality, the writing was able to capture the audience in a way that kept them coming back week after week and the actors were able to execute the story in a way that it was believable that they were trapped on this faraway island.</p>

<p>In total they had the right product, the right team to execute it, and they benefitted from producing the show at the right time that all of these auxiliary technologies came together and facilitated getting the product produced at a high quality into the hands of the viewers.  They also had the insight to know which tech to pursue and how to use it effectively.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick observation, it seems like more stories that make it to the popular section are about either politics or Apple products.  I might make a chart and have graphs to back up my observations next time.  But it makes sense given the time of year it is and the election is happening in a week and Apple just unveiled more products.  Still there is a lot of news that doesn&#8217;t see the light of day.  Not sure if it&#8217;s a good thing or a bad thing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just wanted to tell you about some of the design choices for mashrd. I wanted to support the big social networks to start out with. I really wanted to have App.net but I could not find a button for them. Buffer, bufferapp.com has a button but I had trouble integrating it and I will delve deeper into the API soon. The other issue is for the popular page the network with the highest count gets the button. So that is usually Facebook or Twitter. When App.net has a button I can make a companion site with App.net as it&#8217;s own news listing site, if there is demand for it.  I co-posted this post on the mashrd about page as well as here. <a href="http://mashrd.com/about">About mashrd</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>mashrd - Real-time News with Node.js and socket.io</h1>

<p>TL;DR version: I made a new site called <a href="http://mashrd.com">mashrd</a>, check it out and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>I wanted to try out node.js and socket.io but I wasn&#8217;t sure what kind of webapp I wanted to build with the technology.  I usually try to build something that isn&#8217;t out there yet and something that hasn&#8217;t been done before, at least to my knowledge.  So I&#8217;ve had this idea for a while about a news twitter mashup where the site was organized like reddit or the old digg but using tweets instead.  After looking at some of the data I was getting I decided to include facebook likes and google plus shares.</p>

<p>The first issue was learning node.js for that I went through all of Pedro Teixeira&#8217;s <a href="http://http://nodetuts.com/">Node Tuts</a> videos.  They were very informative and while some of the code that he was using has changed based on the new versions of the software, it really helped because of his choice in exercises.  He showed many parts of the ecosystem for node.js and when the code had changed you could either look in the comments on the same page or, some quick googling could find the right answer.</p>

<h3>Real-time News</h3>

<p>After getting the real-time aspect of the site working from a websockets point of view I needed some actual news on the site.  This could be done by manually submitting but it would require a massive army of submitters.  I used feeds from various news sites most of which I read and some that I found out about by making this site.  I also tried to keep the listing of sites level from all sides, while people on the news fringes will still find something interesting to read.  If you have a site that you think should be included, send me an email or a tweet.</p>

<h3>app.net</h3>

<p>I really wanted to include app.net but I could not find an app.net button.  When app.net gets a button (or I find it) I would like to make a site like this one specifically for app.net because I like the mission and it deserves its own webapp.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>Try it out and let me know what you think.  I&#8217;ll scour these comments obsessively to get feedback and try to change anything I see.  Thanks for taking a look.</p>
